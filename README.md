# Setting up Reverse Proxy via Nginx
## Path based reverse proxy
Suppose, you are running scullog at localhost:9000, and wanted to run at localhost:8888/scullog, then below configuration
```
http{
  map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
      default upgrade;
      '' close;
  }
  server {
		listen	8888;
	  server_name  localhost;
		location /scullog {
			rewrite ^/scullog/?(.*) /$1 break;
			proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;
			proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
		}
	}
}
```
## Port based reverse proxy
Suppose, you are running scullog at localhost:9000, and wanted to run at localhost:8888, then below configuration
```
http{
  map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
      default upgrade;
      '' close;
  }
  server {
		listen	8888;
	  server_name  localhost;
		location / {
			proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;
			proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
		}
	}
}
```

# SSL Support

{
  "ssl": {
    "key": "",

Sample configuration file, can be found <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanketbajoria/scullog/master/default.json">here</a>


# RoadMap
- <s>Docker Image</s>
- <s>Reverse Proxy support</s>
- <s>SSL Support</s>
- Change file permissions and attributes.
- Better layout design for better accessibility (utilize full screen)
- Execute custom cmd for better control.
- View Images and videos 
- PDF viewer
- <s>Drag n drop functionality for file upload</s>
